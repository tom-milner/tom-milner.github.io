This was my MSc(Eng) final project, where I designed and prototyped an inchworm robot to traverse fibre-optic cable ducts of 50mm diameter.
The robot is driven by a cylindrical cam and anisotropic friction, and the final prototype was able to travel 234mm/s, making it the fastest in the literature!

Below is a quick rundown of what the robot does, how it works, and how it performs.
For more thorough technical details (and maths), the thesis document itself can be found [here](../../../public/inchworm_robot/MSc_Thesis.pdf).

# How It Works

A motor drives a cylindrical cam, which linearly extends and contracts the robot.
"Bristles" are distributed radially around the robot's chassis at an angle, allowing the robot to slip in one direction - this is called "anisotropic friction".
As the robot extends and contracts, the front and back modules of the robot grip and release the walls of the pipe in sequence, implementing inchworm motion.

# Cylindrical Cam
To create the cylindrical cam, a python program was written to generate optimum cam paths to minimise "jerk", which would cause vibration in the robot.
The python program output was passed into Fusion360 generate a 3D cam model, as shown below. Rotating the cam shaft cuases the cam follower to reciprocate distance L.

# Anisotropic Friction (Bristles)
The bristles grip and release the pipe walls, allowing the robot to move in one direction - this is what they look like:

Different materials for the bristles were tested to establish their anisotropic friction ranges, and their affect on the final velocity of the robot, producing the following plot.

Bristle assembly C was chosen - more details about the experimentation process can be found in the thesis.


# Assembly
Here are some photos of the design and assembly. The cylindrical cam is mounted in the chassis using integrated linear bearings - more about these in the thesis!
